                 <p> <li><b>Arrive on time</b><br>
            Showing upon time for anything is just common courtesy for everyone around you—and the movie theater is no different. Luckily for people who are habitually late, most theaters list their showtimes for when the commercials and trailers begin—up to 20 minutes before the actual feature film starts. This gives you plenty of time to arrive to the auditorium, find your seats, and grab concessions without missing any of the movie—or annoy everyone by walking in after the lights go down. If you’re going to a very popular film and you know it’s going to be full of people, show up about 20 minutes before showtime to find the best seat in the house.
         </li></p>
   <p>  <li><b>Sharing the armrest</b><br>
        When an auditorium is full of patrons, it’s tough to declare ownership on an armrest and cup holder when you’re sharing it with a complete stranger. Diane Gottsman, a national etiquette expert and founder of The Protocol School of Texas, told Reader’s Digest: “Watch the body language of the guest next to you. There is not a right or wrong way, you just don’t want to take over both sides.” If someone is using the armrest, sharing will be tricky. But if your neighbor removes his or her arm for more than a few minutes, you can claim it for yourself for as long as you’re comfortable. Learn the 13 secrets that movie theater employees won’t tell you.</li></p>
   <p>  <li><b>Don’t hold up the line</b><br>  
    Since most theaters show a number of films that start at different times, understand that although you may have plenty of time to peruse the snack bar offerings, the person behind you may have 30 seconds or less. Try to make your snack decisions before you reach the front of the line, and have your cash or card ready. This way, everyone gets to where they want to go on time. One of the best parts of theaters is that they usually serve the same items at all times: soda, candy like Junior Mints and Sour Patch Kids, and popcorn, so it’s easy to make quick decisions. </li></p>
   <p>  <li><b>3D glasses</b><br>
    While 3D glasses often come wrapped in plastic, it doesn’t mean they’re completely clean. Most theaters just take a used pair and seal them in plastic, and re-use them for the next customer, instead of using brand-new disposable ones. Consider bringing a small alcohol pad to disinfect a pair of 3D glasses. If you don’t have an alcohol pad, you can simply go to the nearest restroom and clean the 3D glasses with soap and water.</li></p>
    <p> <li><b>Smartphones and talking</b><br>
    At this point, everyone knows it’s rude to talk during a film or use their smartphone, and yet here we are. It’s disruptive and rude to everyone seating next to or behind you. The only words that should be spoken out loud are “Excuse me” if you have to use the restroom. And turn off your phone—or put it in silent or airplane mode—so you’re not tempted to use it and annoy the people around you.</li></p>
   <p>  <li><b>Babies</b><br>
    Who doesn’t love babies? In a movie theater, almost everybody! Bringing a baby to a movie is just rude to the audience and your child. Remember that a startled baby is a squalling baby; given how loud theaters are these days, you can protect your offspring by hiring a babysitter. After all, if you’re attending to a baby every five minutes, you’re not going to get much from the movie anyway. Instead, try some to watch movies at home until your child is old enough to handle the movie-going experience. </li></p>
    <p> <li><b>Garbage time</b><br>
    While it’s easy to just leave your empty popcorn containers on the floor or under your seat, theaters are not giant trash cans that happen to show films. Be sure to throw away any trash, such as empty soda cups and candy wrappers, on your way out of the auditorium. Although there are clean-up crews who come in after every movie to tidy up, they have limited time to get the theater ready for the next group of moviegoers. It’s also the right thing to do to clean up after yourself because movie theater employees don’t have enough time to properly clean up auditoriums after each screening.</li></p>
    <p> <li><b>Disruptive neighbors</b><br>
    Sadly, people often flaunt the rules by chatting with friends or texting during a movie. You can either ignore the problem or move seats. Etiquette expert Gottsman’s advice: “Contact the management and let them handle it. Change seats if possible or talk the manager about getting your tickets refunded and go to another show. It’s inconvenient, but sometimes your options are limited and you don’t want to put yourself in an unsafe or terribly awkward position.”
    
    “Ask yourself if you really want to get involved,” she continued. “Chances are, the person who is rudely talking or texting is not very sensitive and he/she may not respond to you with courtesy. You may or may not want to incite an argument.</li></p>
